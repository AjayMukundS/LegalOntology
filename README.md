# Legal Ontology for Indian Court Judgments

This repository hosts the **Legal Ontology for Indian Court Judgments**, a structured representation of key legal entities and their relationships. The ontology models roles like Petitioner, Respondent, Judge, Lawyer, Witness, and Other Persons, alongside legal artifacts such as Statutes, Provisions, Precedents, Courts, and Organizations.

The ontology is designed using OWL 2 standards and saved in RDF syntax for compatibility with popular visualization tools like WebVOWL.
